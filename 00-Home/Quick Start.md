**Install:** Open this folder as an Obsidian vault. Recommended community plugins: Dataview, Templater, Periodic Notes, Obsidian Git, Advanced Tables.

**Flow:**
1. Read *01-Overview / What is Nebula*.
2. Explore *02-Crates* for crate-by-crate details.
3. Use *06-Examples* to copy working patterns.
4. Keep *Roadmap* updated.

**Conventions:**
- English for docs, Russian allowed in comments/notes.
- Each section has `_Index.md` with an automatic list of pages.
